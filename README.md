# Minecraft Skin Pack Converter

Converts Minecraft Bedrock Edition skin packs to a format the Minecraft Java Launcher uses

1. Place your skin pack without its folder (important) in ./input
2. Run convert.py
3. Program creates a launcher_skins.json, replace it with the one in %appdata%/.minecraft/
???. Profit!

Warning! All of your previous skins will be replaced with the ones in the skin pack.

I will update it to merge two launcher_skins.json files once I have free time.

Problems:
  1. No proper thumbnails for the skins :(
